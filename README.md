# GEO GTA III (In Progress...)
Georgian language pack for GTA III

# Attention!!!!!
The game content is not fully translated and tested. Initial translation was done using translate.google.com. Hence, the translation is not fully understandable. Keep that in mind ;)

# How to Build (Manually)
To re-build the project output files you need to manually edit/convert/export all the modified files. 

* fonts.txd: Save fonts (which are in /fonts folder) as PNG images. Then, use TXD editor to replace existing fonts with your PNG images. These fonts are all packed in `/output/models/fonts.txd` file. I recommend you to use Magic.TXD as an editor.
* american.gxt: Use `GTA3 GTX Editor` to edit this file. It contains translated text. However, do not forget that the text symbols are mapped. The mapping is done using Russian keys: one Russian key corresponds to one Georgian key in the game.


# Installation
Extract `output` folder's contents to your GTA III folder.

# Information
* `fonts` folder contains Photoshop PSD font files. GTA III has three fonts: font1, font2 and another font for the pager.

# Extra
Don't forget to install `GTA III - Essential Fixes` mod to fix widescreen and menu bugs (an a lot more): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1744154318
